This is a Node.js app that implements a contact management system using Express, MongoDB, and Passport for authentication. The app has full CRUD functionality for managing contacts and uses Mongoose to define the database schema and model. The app is divided into two routes for managing users and leads. The lead model defines a schema for storing information about leads, including their name, last name, email, phone number, status, state, city, zipcode, address, notes, and creation and last updated dates. The app uses EJS as its templating engine, and includes error handling with custom error messages and flash messages. The app also uses a .env file for local environment variables, and listens on port 3000.
